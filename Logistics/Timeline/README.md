## Project Timeline
_Project timeline regarding the upcomming weeks - this is outdated now (09/02/2023), many of these tasks have been completed and taken even further, these documents have just not been updated_

### TO DO List:
- [ ] Enemy Implementation (Pt. 1) - (Expected Deadline - 05/28/2023)
    - Basic Movement and Visuals 

- [ ] Enemy Implementation (Pt. 2) - (Expected Deadline - TBD)
    - Health/Damage Systm 
 
- [ ] Level Implementation (Pt. 2) - (Expected Deadline - TBD)
    - Can either wait until Pt. 3 to start random generation or implement now
       - Spelunky level gen for random levels might be easiest to implement
       - Otherwise just implement handcrafted levels (look at youtube for examples)
   
- [ ] Basic Player Implementation (Pt. 3,4,5) - (Expected Deadline - 05/28/2023)
   - [X] Temp. Animation Implementations (Pt. 4 + 5)
       - Basic + advanced movements have been implemented in 16 bit fashion
   - [ ] Player Attack Implementation (Pt. 3) 
       - Left Click - quick, light attack
       - Right Click - slow, heavy attack
       - Move the charge attack bound to LMB right now
           - Might be better as a movement ability than as an attack
