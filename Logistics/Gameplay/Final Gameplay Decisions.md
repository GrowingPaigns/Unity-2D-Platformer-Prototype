## Gameplay Documentation (Final)

This section of the repository will hold all ideas related to potential gameplay improvements. 

### Level Ideas:     
- **Mix Of Both (i.e. Spelunky, Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon)** 
    - Regular rooms get randomly generated, Boss rooms/Special/Other rooms are hand-crafted 
        - Provides some consistency while leaving a bit up to random chance
- Starting level 
  - Open chest
  - Option for randomly generated weapon (or choose the one you want)
    - First time playing, users have to use fists (perks included)
    - After beating a boss, they drop a specific weapon, and you can use that in the next run
      - Bosses powers are the powers of the weapon they hold   

- Core Loop
  - Loop: Level, Boss, Level, Boss
    - Levels are side-scrollers and randomly generated 
    - Boss rooms are hand-crafted 
      - Bosses range from having random attacks to hand-crafted attacks 
  - Final Boss: Jupiter
    - Phase 1: Boss is in embryo resting
      - Fight tentacle appendages  
    - Phase 2: Jupiter is trying to eat its way out of the embryo
      - Fight its head
        - at 50%, maybe have to fight a few arms as well     

### Player Ideas:

- [X] Start with basic movement (WASD) 
   - [X] Jumping (Different levels of jump?)
     - Hold to jump higher/farther 
     - W and Spacebar, ^ are key options
     - Wall jump
   - [ ] ~~Slide~~ _(This will be moved to combat script)_
     - CTRL, C, and S are key options 
   - [X] Sprinting
     - Shift 
      
-  [X] Implement Advanced Movements
   - [X] Wall Jumping
     - Space, or A/D+Space to jump away from the wall
   - [X] Wall Sliding 
     - Slide slow when pressed against the wall
     - Press 'S' to slide fast
   - [X] Wall Climbing
     - Press 'W' to climb wall
      
Want controls to be tight and responsive, not slippery 
  - End with any super movement
  - Gradually add changes to movement as the player upgrades themselves/their weapon

### Weapon Ideas:

- [ ] Weapons
  - Lock the player into ONE weapon per run
    - Each weapon has positives and negatives 
      - Shield makes you slower but higher health  
      - Light weapon makes you dodge further/faster
    - Each weapon has a skill tree allowing for crazy combinations
  - Player will earn experience from normal enemies



### Enemy Ideas:

- [ ] Melee + Projectile enemies
    - Heavies (Shoot lots of projectiles at once with a long cooldown)
        - Move slow, lots of health
    - Normals (Shoot projectiles intermittently, short cooldown)
        - Move normally, normal health
    - Swarms (Melee only)
        - Extremely fast movement, minimal health
